## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Supports hot reloading.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
